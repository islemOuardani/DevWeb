                    and implementing the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application that the user
                    interacts with directly. It involves creating the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a
                    website using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    ensure that their code works across different browsers and devices, including desktop and mobile.
                    Front-end developers need to optimize their code for fast loading times and smooth performance.

                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
                </h2>
                <div class="partieHTML">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the foundation of every
                            website and is used to structure content, add media, and create links between pages. HTML
                            uses tags
                            to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and
                            typically come in pairs, with the opening tag indicating the start of the element and the
                            closing tag
                            indicating the end of the element.<br>
                            For example, the basic structure of an HTML document starts with the &lt;html&gt; opening
                            tag and ends with the &lt;/html&gt; closing tag.<br>
                            HTML documents also have a head and a body. The head section contains information about the
                            document such as the title, metadata, and links to stylesheets and scripts. The body section
                            contains
                            the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and multimedia. <br>
                            Some of the most commonly used HTML tags include:<br>
                            &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;: These tags are used to define headings of different levels, with
                            &lt;h1&gt; being the largest and &lt;h6&gt; being the smallest.<br>
                            &lt;p&gt;: This tag is used to define a paragraph of text.<br>
                            &lt;a&gt;: This tag is used to create a hyperlink to another web page or resource.<br>
                            &lt;img&gt;: This tag is used to insert an image into the web page.<br>
                            &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;: These tags are used to define unordered and ordered lists,
                            respectively.<br>
                            &lt;li&gt;: This tag is used to define a list item in a list.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
                </h2>
                <div class="partieHTML">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            CSS is a language used to add styles to HTML documents. It provides web developers with a
                            way to control the visual appearance of web pages by setting properties such as
                            <strong>font styles</strong>, <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>layout</strong>, and
                            more.<br>
                            CSS is designed to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, allowing
                            developers to create reusable styles that can be applied to multiple elements throughout the
                            document. One of the main benefits of CSS is that it enables consistent styling across a
                            website, making it easier to maintain and update. Additionally, CSS can be used to create
                            responsive designs, which adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a better
                            user experience. Overall, CSS is an essential tool for web developers, providing greater
                            control and flexibility in web design.

                            CSS syntax consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector is used to select
                            HTML elements to which the style rules will be applied, and the declaration block contains
                            one or more properties and values that define how the selected elements should be styled.

                    <img src="../images/css.png" alt="logoCSS">
                </div>
                <p id="suite">Here's an example:<br>
                    h1 {<br>
                    color: blue;<br>
                    font-size: 36px;<br>
                    }<br>
                    In this example, h1 is the selector, and color: blue and font-size: 36px are the properties
                    and values in the declaration block.
                    There are several types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, ID
                    selectors, and attribute selectors.
                    Element selectors select all instances of a particular HTML element, such as h1 or p.
                    Class selectors select elements with a specific class attribute, denoted by a period, such
                    as .intro.
                    ID selectors select a single element with a specific ID attribute, denoted by a pound sign,
                    such as #header. Attribute selectors select elements based on their attributes, such as
                    [href] to select all elements with an href attribute.

                    CSS properties can be set to specific values, such as color: blue,
                    or they can be set to relative values, such as margin: 10%.
                    There are many CSS properties available for use, and they can be combined in countless ways
                    to create unique and engaging designs.
                    CSS can also be used to control the layout of web pages. This includes positioning elements,
                    setting the width and height of elements, and defining the flow of content on the page. Some
                    common CSS layout properties include display, position, float, and flexbox. CSS layout is an
                    important aspect of web design, as it helps create a cohesive and organized structure for
                    web pages.
                    Responsive design is a technique used to create web pages that adapt to different screen
                    sizes and devices. CSS plays a critical role in responsive design, allowing developers to
                    create styles that adjust based on the size of the viewport. This includes setting
                    breakpoints, defining media queries, and using CSS grids and flexbox. Responsive design is
                    essential for providing a positive user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
                    CSS frameworks are pre-written CSS code libraries that developers can use to quickly and
                    easily style their web pages. They often include pre-designed templates, UI components, and
                    layout systems. Some popular CSS frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize.
                    CSS frameworks can be a useful tool for streamlining web development and ensuring a
                    consistent design across a website.</p>

                    JS (JavaScript)
                </h2>
                <div class="partieHTML">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a high-level programming language, which means that it abstracts away many of
                            the low-level details that other programming languages, like C or Assembly, require the
                            developer to handle. This abstraction makes it easier to learn and use than some other
                            programming languages, but it also means that it can be slower in performance. However,
                            modern web browsers have optimized their JavaScript engines to be quite fast, which has made
                            it possible to create complex and interactive web applications using JavaScript.
                            One of the unique features of JavaScript is that it can be executed on both the client-side
                            (in the user's web browser) and the server-side (using Node.js). This versatility makes it a
                            popular choice for web development because it allows developers to use the same language on
                            both the front-end and the back-end of a web application, which can make it easier to create
                            more cohesive and efficient web applications.
                            In addition to being a standalone language, JavaScript also has a vast ecosystem of
                            frameworks, libraries, and tools that can be used to simplify web development. For example,
                            React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Angular is a framework
                            for building complex web applications, and jQuery is a library that makes it easier to
                            manipulate HTML elements and handle events.
                            Overall, JavaScript is an essential technology for web development, and its versatility,
                            ease of use, and vast ecosystem of tools and resources make it a popular choice for
                            developers worldwide.
